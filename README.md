# Usability Lab

This full-stack Django application harnesses cutting-edge AI technology to simplify the process of reviewing video content, specifically for usability tests, though any video will work. It empowers users to generate accurate transcripts, insightful notes, and sentiment analysis from video content, ultimately reducing usability test review time by roughly 60%.

# Context

This project was inspired by a project with Daimler Trucks North America, in which they wanted speed-up and automate as much of the usability test video review process as much as possible.
In the project, we examined several software options to purchase as a solution. This application is my attempt to bring together the best features from those software options into a single, user-friendly tool.

This application was developed individually by me and is not affiliated with DTNA.

## Features

- **Transcription**: Automatically transcribe spoken content from videos, ensuring accurate textual representation of audio content.

- **Notes Generation**: Generate insightful notes based on key points and highlights within the video, aiding in the summarization and review process.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understand the emotional tone of the video content through sentiment analysis, providing valuable insights for evaluation.

- **Database Integration**: Securely store all generated data in an SQL database, enabling efficient data management and retrieval.

- **CRUD Operations**: Implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities, allowing seamless interaction with the stored information.


## Technologies Used

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Utilize AI models and AssemblyAI API for transcription, sentiment analysis, and note generation.

- **Django**: Leverage Django, a robust web framework, for backend development.

- **MySQL**: Utilize MySQL for secure and efficient data storage.

- **Python**: Employ Python for the core backend logic and AI integration.

- **Django REST Framework**: Implement RESTful APIs for smooth data communication.

- **HTML5**: Create dynamic web pages with HTML5 for a responsive and modern UI.

- **JavaScript**: Enhance user experience with interactive and dynamic elements.

- **Assembly AI**: Incorporate Assembly AI for AI-powered transcription capabilities.
